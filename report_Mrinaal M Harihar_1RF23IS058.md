Time and Memory Comparisons:

Before Optimization:

Execution Time: ~0.002 seconds

Memory Usage: ~500 B

After Optimization:

Execution Time: 1.8167e-05 seconds

Memory Usage: 328 B (reduced by ~35%)

Optimizations Applied:

Vectorized Computations:

Switched from loop-based operations to NumPyâ€™s built-in functions for matrix arithmetic.

Impact: Significantly reduced execution time due to efficient C-level optimizations.

Memory Management:

Avoided intermediate variables by directly chaining operations.

Impact: Reduced memory allocations and faster garbage collection.

Optimized Expression Evaluation:

Reordered calculations to minimize redundant computations in the complex expression.

Impact: Reduced both time and space complexity.
